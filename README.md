# Multi_Agent_Protocol_XAI

To run Protocol.py, make sure to have a directory that contains an apx file with a name matching "debate_graph_\S+" :
```bash
python3 /home/user/path/Protocol.py /home/user/directory/path/ name_of_the_output
```

For the experimentations, the script bench.sh needs to be in the same directory as debategraph_generation.py and Protocol.py.
To run it, use the following command :
```bash
/home/user/path/bench.sh
```
